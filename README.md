# CIV-beta-0.1

Welcome to CIV!

To enter CIV, you must prepare your passport.
If you have one, just go to the airport and you will pass the immigration in no time!

However, don't worry if you don't have your passport.
You can make yourself a new one at the post office!
Just with your name, email, and a secret key that will work as your password, you can enter CIV right away!

But beware, there's no deleting your passport once made :) And ---

that's it.
C'mon, it's beta-0.1!
